This file helps to predict the Exoplanets on the basis of the given star properties.
The Data Gathering has been done with the help of NASA Archive website and implemented the machine learning alogrtihms to find out best model for prediction
The random forest algorithms works best out of SVM and ANN which gives accuracy of 99%.
